Go program run a html server, convert and display user input as suitable ascii-art.

## Usage: how to run
1. Initiate server on command line:
   ```
   go run .
   ```
2. Access the page: http://localhost:8080/

If you use browser back/forward, the page may have glitch. In that case, refreshing the page may reset the situation but my recommendation is just don't use them. I tried to prevent these browser functions but it seems hard because many browsers prevent the scripts from controlling browsing history. If you know the trick, I'd happy to hear!
